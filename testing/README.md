Testing and Quality Assurance
This directory is dedicated to the project's testing suite, ensuring the reliability, functionality, and performance of the application. It will include:

Unit Tests: For individual functions and modules.

Integration Tests: To verify interactions between different components.

End-to-End (E2E) Tests: To simulate user flows and validate the entire system.

Performance Tests: For benchmarking and identifying bottlenecks.

Implementing a robust testing framework here will be crucial for continuous integration and delivery, maintaining code quality as the project scales.
