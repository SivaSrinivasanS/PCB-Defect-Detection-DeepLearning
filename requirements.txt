# Emergency fix: Use tf-nightly to support Python 3.13
# TensorFlow has not yet published official stable wheels for Python 3.13 (even for 2.15.0)
# So we switch to tf-nightly which typically supports newer Python versions earlier

# Updated requirements.txt
streamlit==1.46.0
tf-nightly  # replaces tensorflow==2.10.0 or 2.15.0 for Python 3.13 compatibility
opencv-python
numpy
pillow
matplotlib
scikit-learn

# WARNING:
# tf-nightly is a development build. Use for testing/development only.
# For production, consider switching to Python 3.10 and sticking to a stable TensorFlow version

# After updating this file:
# 1. Commit and push to GitHub
# 2. Redeploy or restart the Streamlit app
