Model File Download
Due to GitHub's file size limitations for direct repository inclusion, the trained deep learning model (pcb_cnn.h5) is not committed to this repository. This is a common practice for large model files in open-source projects.

To ensure the application runs correctly and utilizes the pre-trained model for inference, please follow these steps:

Download the Model File:

Navigate to the following Google Drive link:
Download pcb_cnn.h5 Model from Google Drive

Download the pcb_cnn.h5 file from this shared folder.

Place the Model in the Correct Directory:

Once downloaded, move the pcb_cnn.h5 file into the models/ directory within your cloned project.

The final path should be: your-repo-root/models/pcb_cnn.h5

After placing the model file, you can proceed with running the Streamlit application or further training as described in the "How to Run Locally" section.
